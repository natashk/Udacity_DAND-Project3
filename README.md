# Udacity Data Analyst for Enterprise Nanodegree

## Project 3: Investigate a Dataset

In this project, I analyzed IMDB movies dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the **Python** libraries **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to make analysis easier.

I explored following questions:

 - Are long or short movies get higher user rating?
 - Are old or new movies get higher user rating?
 - What genres are the most popular in this dataset?
 - What genres are getting higher rating?
